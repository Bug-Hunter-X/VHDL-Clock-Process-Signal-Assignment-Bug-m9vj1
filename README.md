# VHDL Clock Process Signal Assignment Bug
This repository demonstrates a common bug in VHDL code involving signal assignments within a clocked process.  The bug can lead to unexpected behavior and data corruption.

## Bug Description
The provided VHDL code contains a subtle error in how signals are assigned within a rising_edge(clk) process.  This can result in inaccurate signal updates or race conditions depending on the timing and how the signals interact with other parts of the design.

## Bug Analysis
The original code incorrectly handles signal updates, potentially leading to situations where output is not correctly synchronized with the input or to improper state changes in more complex designs.   The problem often involves assuming a signal will be updated instantaneously within the clock cycle, which is not always true.

## Solution
The solution demonstrates a more robust and correct way to handle signal assignments within a clocked process to prevent such issues.  This may involve proper signal synchronization or careful ordering of signal updates to prevent race conditions.
